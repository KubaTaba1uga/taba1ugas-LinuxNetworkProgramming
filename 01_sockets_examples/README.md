### Client-Side Socket Programming (Steps):
- Create Socket: Use the ```socket()``` function to create a communication endpoint.
- Specify Server Address: Define the serverâ€™s IP address and port using a structure like ```sockaddr_in```.
- Connect to Server: Use ```connect()``` to establish a connection with the server.
 Send/Receive Data: Use functions like ```send()``` and ```recv()``` to exchange data with the server.
- Close Socket: Use ```close()``` to terminate the connection and release resources.

### Server-Side Socket Programming (Steps):
- Create Socket: Similar to the client, create a socket using the ```socket()``` function.
- Bind to Address: Bind the socket to a specific IP address and port using ```bind()```.
- Listen for Connections: Use ```listen()``` to wait for incoming connection requests.
- Accept Connection: Use ```accept()``` to accept an incoming client connection, creating a new socket for communication.
- Send/Receive Data: Use ```send()``` and ```recv()``` to communicate with the connected client.
- Close Sockets: Close both the client socket and the main listening socket when finished.
